# Todos App

## Example of a single page app using json-server and AJAX.

## Getting started

This application uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to provide you with an API. To make sure it is installed, you will need to run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
cp sample-db.json db.json
```

To run json-server, run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start json-server and a web server. It should open a browser window at the same time. You will need to leave this running while you are working on this application.

The URL for your web application is `http://localhost:8080`.
